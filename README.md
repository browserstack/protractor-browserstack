# protractor-browserstack

[Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor/) Integration with BrowserStack.

## Setup

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Update `*.conf.js` files inside the `conf/` directory with your BrowserStack Username and Access Key. (These can be found in the [settings](https://www.browserstack.com/accounts/settings) section on BrowserStack accounts page)
- Alternatively, you can export the environment variables for the Username and Access Key of your BrowserStack account. `export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username> && export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>`

### Run the tests

- To run single test, run `npm run single`
- To run parallel tests, run `npm run parallel`
- To run local tests, run `npm run local`


### Notes

- The latest version of protractor needs the ‘browserName’ capability mentioned for tests to be executed.
- In order to test on different set of browsers, check out our [code generator](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/python#setting-os-and-browser)
