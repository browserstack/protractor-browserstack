## Setup

* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies `npm install`
* Update `*.conf.js` files inside the `conf/` directory with your [BrowserStack Username and Access Key](https://www.browserstack.com/accounts/settings)

## Running your tests
* To run a single test, run `npm run single`
* To run local tests, run `npm run local`
* To run parallel tests, run `npm run parallel`

 Understand how many parallel sessions you need by using our [Parallel Test Calculator](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/parallel-calculator?ref=github)

## Notes
* You can view your test results on the [BrowserStack automate dashboard](https://www.browserstack.com/automate)
* To test on a different set of browsers, check out our [platform configurator](https://www.browserstack.com/automate/node#setting-os-and-browser)
* You can export the environment variables for the Username and Access Key of your BrowserStack account
  
  ```
  export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username> &&
  export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```
* Set browserstackUser and browserstackKey in config to automatically mark your test results, "completed" and "failed", on browserstack dashboard. [Sample config](conf/single.conf.js)
